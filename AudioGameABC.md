# A Game Based on Speech Recognition #

Input: The voice of a player ( A English Sentence/ Time)
Output: If Our program can recognize the sentence, the armed aircraft will destroy the falling asteroid.



# Detailed Description #

Our work is based on the CMU Sphinx4 toolkit.
What is our job?
1) The game itself is a good application of the toolkit.
2) We hope to figure out the detailed architecture of the toolkit. (Maybe we will use a picture to show this)
3) Try to improve the interactive performance of the game. (We need to hack the kernel of the CMU sphinx4)

# The Expected Result #


A FREE and interesting speech recognition game.
Get a thorough understanding of the CMU Sphinx4 toolkit.
Try to optimize some parts of the system.(Optional)

# What we have done! #


An amazing game.
Developed using the CMU Sphinx4 and JGame 2D game engine.
Certainly, this is just a beginningâ€¦
